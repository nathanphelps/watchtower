> Cross-platform Laravel queue monitoring and worker management dashboard

Watchtower provides queue monitoring and worker management capabilities similar to Laravel Horizon, but with full cross-platform support including Windows. Unlike Horizon, which relies on PCNTL signals (Unix-only), Watchtower uses a polling-based approach for worker control that works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Features

- 📊 **Queue Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time job tracking, status monitoring, and metrics
- ⚙️ **Worker Management** - Start, stop, pause, resume workers from the web UI
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- 📋 **Job Tracking** - Job status, payload, exceptions, retries, worker info
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Alpine.js dark-themed dashboard (no build step required)
- 🗑️ **Automatic Cleanup** - Time-based pruning of old job records

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 11 or 12
- Redis (for worker control commands)

## Installation

```bash
composer require nathanphelps/watchtower
```

Publish the configuration and assets:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=watchtower-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=watchtower-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

## Configuration

The package configuration is published to `config/watchtower.php`:

```php
return [
    // Dashboard URL path
    'path' => env('WATCHTOWER_PATH', 'watchtower'),

    // Route middleware
    'middleware' => ['web'],

    // Authorization gate
    'gate' => env('WATCHTOWER_GATE', 'viewWatchtower'),

    // Job retention (days)
    'retention' => [
        'completed' => 7,
        'failed' => 30,
    ],

    // Supervisor configuration
    'supervisors' => [
        'default' => [
            'connection' => 'redis',
            'queue' => ['default'],
            'min_processes' => 1,
            'max_processes' => 10,
            'tries' => 3,
            'timeout' => 60,
        ],
    ],
];
```

## Usage

### Starting the Supervisor

Run the supervisor to automatically manage your queue workers:

```bash
php artisan watchtower:supervisor
```

The supervisor will:

- Maintain the minimum number of workers
- Restart failed workers automatically
- Monitor worker health via heartbeats

### Manual Worker Control

Start a single worker manually:

```bash
php artisan watchtower:worker default
```

### Accessing the Dashboard

Visit `/watchtower` in your browser. By default, the dashboard is only accessible in local environments. Configure the gate in your `AuthServiceProvider` for production:

```php
Gate::define('viewWatchtower', function ($user) {
    return in_array($user->email, [
        'admin@example.com',
    ]);
});
```

### Pruning Old Jobs

Watchtower automatically prunes old job records. You can also run the prune command manually:

```bash
php artisan watchtower:prune
```

## How It Works

### Polling-Based Control

Unlike Horizon which uses PCNTL signals (Unix-only), Watchtower uses Redis for worker control:

1. Dashboard sends command to Redis: `SET watchtower:worker:{id}:command "stop"`
2. Worker checks Redis every 3 seconds
3. Worker reads and executes the command
4. Worker confirms status in database

This approach provides:

- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ No PCNTL dependency
- ✅ Simple debugging
- ⚠️ 1-3 second response delay (acceptable for worker management)

### Dashboard Updates

The dashboard polls for updates every 3 seconds (configurable). This provides near-real-time visibility into:

- Job counts and status
- Worker health and activity
- Throughput metrics

## Artisan Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `watchtower:supervisor` | Start the supervisor to manage workers |
| `watchtower:worker {queue}` | Start a single worker process |
| `watchtower:prune` | Prune old job records |
