Using the web interface to monitor and manage your queues.

---

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to your configured path (default: `/watchtower`).

**Authorization:**

- Local environment: Accessible by default
- Production: Requires passing the `viewWatchtower` gate

---

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard shows:

### Stats Cards

Real-time counts for:

- **Pending** - Jobs waiting to process
- **Processing** - Currently running
- **Completed** - Successfully finished
- **Failed** - Jobs that threw exceptions
- **Last Hour** - Throughput indicator
- **Workers** - Active worker count

### Recent Jobs

Live-updating table of the 20 most recent jobs with:

- Job class name
- Queue
- Status badge
- Timestamp

### Active Workers

Grid of currently running workers showing:

- Worker ID (truncated)
- Status (running/paused)
- Queue assignment
- PID

---

## Jobs Page

### Filtering Jobs

Use the filter bar to narrow results:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| Status | All, Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed |
| Queue | Dynamic list from your jobs |
| Search | Job class name |

### Job Detail

Click "View" on any job to see:

- **Overview** - Job ID, class, queue, connection, attempts, worker
- **Timestamps** - Queued, started, completed, duration
- **Payload** - Serialized job data (JSON formatted)
- **Exception** - Stack trace for failed jobs

---

## Workers Page

### Starting Workers

1. Click **"+ Start Worker"**
2. Select queue from dropdown
3. Click **"Start Worker"**

The worker starts with your supervisor's default configuration.

### Worker Controls

Each worker card has action buttons:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Pause** | Finish current job, then wait |
| **Resume** | Continue processing (from paused) |
| **Stop** | Finish current job, then exit |

> **Note:** Commands take 1-3 seconds to take effect (polling interval).

### Worker Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 Running | Actively processing jobs |
| 🟡 Paused | Waiting for resume command |
| ⚫ Stopped | Process has exited |

### Health Indicator

Workers show their last heartbeat time. Healthy workers update every 3 seconds.

## Failed Jobs Page

### Viewing Exceptions

Click **"View"** to see the full exception trace in a modal:

- Exception class and message
- File and line number
- Full stack trace

### Retrying Jobs

Click **"Retry"** to re-queue a failed job:

- Status resets to "pending"
- Attempts counter increments
- Job re-enters queue for processing

### Deleting Jobs

Click **"Delete"** to permanently remove the job record.

> **Warning:** This only removes the record from Watchtower's tracking. It does not affect Laravel's failed_jobs table if you're also using that.
